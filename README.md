### SP-synthesis-lek
My code contributions to StreamPULSE metabolism synthesis

- This script brings together field measurements of river width for the StreamPULSE synthesis statset sites, compares field measurements to estimates of width derived from satellite imagery and hydraulic geometry scaling, and exports a file of widths to use for the synthesis paper (Bernhardt et al.)  
- Note that Estimate_width.R references hydraulic geometry coefficients derived [here](https://github.com/lekoenig/US-hydraulic-geometry.git)
